# --Battleships Game--

Greetings! This game is my fourth mini-project that I've completed in Python.  
The main goal of the game is to sink enemy ships by guessing coordinates to attack.

# --Getting Started--

**Step 1** - Download Python (yeah... that's basically it)  
**Step 2** - Run the game (obviously)

# --Rules/Mechanics--

I've written the rules in the game for you to see before starting.  
But just in case, here are the main things to do in the game:  
- **Pick 5 coordinates** to place your ships  
- The enemy will also have 5 ships
- **Select a random coordinate** to attack (not case-sensitive)
- First one who has **4 ships sunk loses**!

...and that just about sums up this README. What are you waiting for?? GO PLAY THE GA-
