# ðŸ“–About

Greetings! This game is my fourth Python mini-project that I've completed.  
The main goal of the game is to sink enemy ships by guessing coordinates to attack.

# ðŸš€Getting Started

**Step 1** - Download and install Python here:  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3134/ (scroll down)  
**Step 2** - Download the game files  
**Step 3** - Run the game

# ðŸŽ“Rules/Mechanics

I've written the rules in the game for you to see before starting.  
But just in case, here are the main things to keep in mind:  
- You will have to pick 5 coordinates to place your ships.  
- The enemy will also have 5 ships.
- You will have to select a random coordinate to attack on your turn.
- First one who has 4 ships sunk loses!
